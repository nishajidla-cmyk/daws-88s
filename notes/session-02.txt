Architecture

Architecture means the design of a system and how components are connected.

Client–Server Architecture
- Client sends request
- Server processes request
- Server sends response back to client

Examples:
- Browser → Web Server
- Laptop → EC2 instance (SSH)

AWS Example:
Client: Laptop
Server: EC2
Network: Internet
Protocol: SSH
Security: Key pair and Security Group
